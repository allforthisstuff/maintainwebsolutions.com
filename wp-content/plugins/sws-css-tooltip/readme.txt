== FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

Q: After activating the plugin how do I use the Shortcodes SWS CSS Tooltip?
A: In order to use the SWS CSS Tooltip plugin you must have a valid license of Styles with Shortcodes for WordPress. 

Go to a Post or Page and click on the "S" icon above the visual RTF editor. Then you will get a pop up. Choose the category "Tooltips" from the drop down and then choose the effect you would like to insert.

Q: Can I adjust the font size in the tooltip or speech bubble?
A: Yes, when you insert the Shortcode you will be shown a slider, which allows you to set the size of the font.

Q: Can I adjust the width of the tooltip or speech bubble?
A: Yes, when you insert the Shortcode you will be shown a slider, which allows you to set the width.

Q: Can I add my own colors to the Tooltip Shortcode?
A: Yes, you can. If you know CSS then you can easily insert the additional code in the CSS. If you look in the folder /sws-css-tooltip/thetooltip/ you will find the Stylesheet file: thetooltip.css.
Open this and scroll down. You will see how each of the colors are defined. Once you have added your CSS you need to update the shortcode. Go to the wp-admin and then click on Shortcodes in the left side. 
Look for the Shortcode named "Tooltip (CSS3)" or "Speech bubble (CSS3)" depending on which you would like to update. Click EDIT. In the top you will see a box named "Shortcode fields" in this you will find a Shortcode field named "Color Scheme". Click on the pencil and then scroll down to the field "Drop-Down Values" - and then simply insert the name of the color (as you defined it in the CSS).

If you mess up the Shortcode you can always go to the Options Panel and then click on "Bundles". There you will find a drop-down that contains the bundles you have installed. Choose "CSS Tooltip" and then "Click to restore bundle". This way you restore everything and it should work again.
