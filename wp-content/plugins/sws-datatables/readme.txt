== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: After activating the plugin how do I use the Shortcodes SWS Datatables?
A: In order to use the SWS Datatables plugin you must have a valid license of Styles with Shortcodes for WordPress. 

Go to a Post or Page and click on the "S" icon above the visual RTF editor. Then you will get a pop up. Choose the category "Tables" from the drop down and then choose the effect you would like to insert. 

Q: How do I create a table ?
A: In order to create datatable you need your data as a CSV file. If you have created your table in e.g. Microsoft Excel then you need to export it as CSV (Comma-delimited). 

If you prefer to use a program like NotePad to create a text file, the same list would look something like this.
